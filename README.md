## Objective
The challenge is to create a blog about anything I enjoy or find interesting, and post at least 3 articles.

## What I will need
- Home page (should display an overview of what the blog is about, as well as showcasing the top 3 blog posts. Should also have a beautiful homepage image.)
- "new" post page (Should allow users the capability of creating a new blog. The post should have a Title, Content, Author and an image.)
- Rich text needs to be added to the content so that people can style their articles, a third party wysiwyg library such as SummerNote will be needed in order to do this.
- An "edit" post page which should allow users to edit existing blogs.
- An Archive page to view all posts 
- A user should allow users to display all the posts on the home page just the title and a preview image. User should be able to view full article when clicked on.
- A post "single" page - Once a user selects a blog they should be able to see the full article with title, image, content and author.
- A registration and sign in page - Users have to register before they can create a new blog post so that we know who has created a post and to prevent spam from being created. The registration must have the following fields:

Users should also be able to upload pictures

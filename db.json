            "content": "I would say it depends entirely on whether you have kids or not. Both countries like to boast that their country is the better place to live, but neither country makes an effort to learn what the other country has to offer. Canada has paid leave and many companies offer benefits to new mothers/parents from 17 weeks to as much as 52 weeks. During this time one of the spouses can claim Employment Insurance (EI) for approximatery 15 weeks. Genereally EI payments are 55% of your weekly earnings but have a maximum payment of $485 per week. Parents can also split the allocated time if they choose. The United States on the other hand does not currently mandate any sort of maternity leave. However, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for extreme sickness and birth of a child. While this this 12 weeks of unpaid leave is not really seen as a proper maternity leave, it can be used under the FMLA as such. The FMLA however does nt apply to companies with under 50 employees. Some states such as California and new Jersey include paid maternity benefits into their disability insurance, but each state has a choice of whether to include it or not.",
